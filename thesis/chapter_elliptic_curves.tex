In this chapter, we will give a short overview on the basic theory of Elliptic Curves.
However, since the details are mostly the theory of algebraic geometry and do not bear too much on the main content of our work, we will keep it brief and refer the reader to the excellent textbook \cite{arithmetic_elliptic_curves}.
