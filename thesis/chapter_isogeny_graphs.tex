Before we start with the discussion of isogeny graphs and their mathematical structure, we shortly introduce the required foundations on elliptic curves.
However, since these do not bear directly on our work, and are usually developed using heavy algebraic geometry, we do not include proofs for this part.
The reader is referred to the standard work on the subject \cite{arithmetic_elliptic_curves}.
We also include references to this work for each statement.

\section{Foundations of Elliptic Curves and Isogenies}

\subsection{Elliptic Curves and the group law}
Consider a field $k$ with algebraic closure $\bar{k}$.
An \emph{elliptic curve} is a nonsingular projective curve of genus 1 together with a special point $\IdPoint$.
If the characteristic of $k$ is not 2 or 3, each elliptic curve $E$ is isomorphic to a projective plane curve given by an affine equation of the form
\begin{equation*}
    E: y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B
\end{equation*}
such that the special point is the projective point at infinity $\IdPoint = (0 : 1 : 0)$ \cite[Prop.~III.3.1]{arithmetic_elliptic_curves}.
Furthermore, an isomorphism class of elliptic curves is uniquely determined by its j-invariant \cite[Prop.~III.1.4]{arithmetic_elliptic_curves}, defined as
\begin{equation*}
    j(E) := -1728 \frac {(4A)^3} {-16(4A^3 + 27B^3)}
\end{equation*}
Since isomorphic curves have the same properties in all aspects that matter for this work, we will use the terms elliptic curves and isomorphism classes of elliptic curves interchangeably from now on.
In particular, note that whenever we count elliptic curves with special properties, we only count isomorphism classes. 

The reason that makes elliptic curves so important is that they are abelian varieties, i.e. become groups in a way compatible with the geometric structure.
There are different characterizations of this group law, the most explicit being its representation by polynomials.
More concretely, if the curve is given by an affine equation $y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$, then the sum of two affine points $P = (x_1 : y_1 : 1)$ and $Q = (x_2 : y_2 : 1)$ is given as
\begin{equation*}
    P + Q = ( \lambda^2\mu - x_1\mu^3 - x_2\mu^3 : \lambda(2x_1\mu^2 + x_2\mu^2 - \lambda^2) - y_1\mu^3 : \mu^3 )
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{equation*}
    (\lambda : \mu) = \begin{cases}
        (y_2 - y_1 : x_2 - x_1) & \text{if $x_1 \neq x_2$} \\
        (3x_1^2 + A : 2y_1) & \text{if $x_1 = x_2$}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
Moreover, we declare the special point $\IdPoint$ to be the identity element of the group.
The nontrivial result is now that this defines a group law on the set of points of $E$ \cite[Prop.~III.2.2]{arithmetic_elliptic_curves}. 
A more theoretical characterization of the group law is given by \cite[Prop.~III.3.4]{arithmetic_elliptic_curves}, which states that the above operation $+$ is the same as the group law induced by a natural isomorphism $E \cong \mathrm{Pic}(E)$ from the points of $E$ to its Picard group. 

The two most important subgroups of the group $E$ are now the $n$-torsion group
\begin{equation*}
    E[n] := \{ P \in E \ | \ \underbrace{P + ... + P}_{\text{$n$ times}} = \IdPoint \}
\end{equation*}
and the subgroup of $k$-rational points
\begin{equation*}
    E(k) := \{ P \in E \ | \ \text{$P = (x : y : z)$ for some $x, y, z \in k$} \}
\end{equation*}

A property of elliptic curves that can be used for some slightly exotic cryptographic primitives (like identity-based crypto, or the verifiable delay function we present in Section~\ref{sec:verifiable_delay_function}) is the Weil pairing.
Let $m \geq 2$ be an integer (coprime to $p = \mathrm{char}(k)$ if $\mathrm{char}(k) \neq 0$).
Then there exists a map, the $m$-th \emph{Weil pairing}
\begin{equation*}
    e_m: E[m] \times E[m] \to \mu_m
\end{equation*}
where $\mu_m \subseteq \C^*$ is the group of $m$-th roots of unity.
It has the following properties (see \cite[Prop.~III.8.1]{arithmetic_elliptic_curves}):
\begin{itemize}
    \item $e_m$ is bilinear, i.e. $e_m(S + S', T) = e_m(S, T)e_m(S', T)$ and similar for the second argument.
    \item $e_m$ is alternating, i.e. $e_m(T, T) = 1$.
    \item $e_m$ is nondegenerate, i.e. if $e_m(S, \cdot)$ is the constant map $\IdPoint$, then $S = \IdPoint$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Isogenies}
An \emph{isogeny} between two elliptic curves $E$ and $E'$ is a morphism (in the sense of algebraic geometry) that maps $\IdPoint$ to $\IdPoint$.
The first important result is that an isogeny is automatically a group homomorphism \cite[Thm~III.4.8]{arithmetic_elliptic_curves}.
The simplest example of an isogeny is the multiplication-by-$m$ map on an elliptic curve $E$
\begin{equation*}
    [m]: E \to E, \quad P \mapsto \underbrace{P + ... + P}_{\text{$m$ times}}
\end{equation*}

An isogeny $\psi: E \to E'$ is closely connected to the field extension $k[E]/\psi_*k[E']$, where $\psi_*: k[E'] \to k[E]$ is the associated map of $k$-algebras.
The degree of $\psi$ is then given by the degree of this field extension (it is always finite), and $\psi$ is said to be separable, if $k[E]/\psi_*k[E']$ is.
Similarly, we can define the separability degree of an isogeny.
It is a fact of algebraic geometry that both degree and separability degree behave multiplicatively under composition.
Furthermore, the separability degree of an isogeny is equal to the size of its kernel \cite[Thm~III.4.10]{arithmetic_elliptic_curves}.
It is common to call isogenies of degree $m$ also $m$-isogenies.

Studying again the example of the multiplication-by-$m$ isogeny $[m]: E \to E$, one can show that this has degree $m^2$.
Its kernel is obviously the subgroup $E[m]$, and thus, if $[m]$ is separable, we see that $E[m] \cong (\Z/m\Z)^2$.
We will explain what happens in the case that $[m]$ is inseparable in the next section.

A very important result on isogenies is that they can be classified by their kernel $\ker(\psi) \subseteq E$, which is always a finite group.
More concretely, up to isomorphism, there is a one to one correspondence
\begin{align*}
    \{ \text{Pairs $(\psi, E')$ where $\psi: E \to E'$ is a separable isogeny} \}  \ &\to \ \{ \text{Finite subgroups $G \leq E$} \} \\
    (E', \psi) \ &\mapsto \ \ker(\psi)
\end{align*}
In particular, for a finite subgroup $G \leq E$ there is a unique (up to isomorphism) elliptic curve $E'$ and separable isogeny $\psi: E \to E'$ with kernel $G$.
We also denote $E'$ by $E/G$, as that is the group structure on $E'$ by the isomorphism theorem (morphisms of projective irreducible curves are always surjective).

Furthermore, this correspondence is compatible with the inclusion of finite subgroups as follows.
If $G_1 \leq G_2 \leq E$ are two finite subgroups, then the unique separable isogeny $\psi: E \to E/G_2$ with kernel $G_2$ factors through the isogeny $\phi: E \to E/G_1$, i.e. there is an isogeny $\rho: E/G_1 \to E/G_2$ such that the diagram
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \node (E0) at (-4, 0) {$E$};
        \node (E1) at (0, 0) {$E/G_1$};
        \node (E2) at (4, 0) {$E/G_2$};

        \draw [->] (E0) -- (E1) node [midway, above] {$\phi$};
        \draw [->] (E1) -- (E2) node [midway, above] {$\rho$};
        \draw [->] (E0) to [bend left] node [midway, above] {$\psi$} (E2);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
commutes.
An analogous statement also holds for inseparable isogenies.
If $\mathrm{char}(k) = p$, then an inseparable isogeny $\psi: E \to E'$ always factors through the $p$-th power Frobenius $\pi: E \to E^{(p)}$ (which is of course purely inseparable), where $E^{(p)}$ is the elliptic curve with all coefficients of the defining equation raised to the $p$-th power.
Note that can also define the operation $\cdot^{(p)}$ on isogenies, by again raising each coefficient in the defining polynomials to the $p$-th power.
This way, $\cdot^{(p)}$ becomes an endofunctor on the category of elliptic curves over $\bar{\F}_p$ and their isogenies.

Sometimes we will mention cyclic isogenies, which are isogenies of cyclic kernel.
Hence, for an isogeny $\phi: E \to E'$, being cyclic is equivalent to the fact that $\phi$ does not factor through $[m]$ for any integer $m \geq 2$.

The final notion we require in this context is the one of the dual isogeny.
Since the kernel of an isogeny $\psi: E \to E'$ is a subgroup of size $\deg_s(\psi)$, we see that it is contained in $E[\deg(\psi)] = \ker[\deg(\psi)]$.
Now the previous correspondence shows that $\psi$ factors through through the multiplication map $[\deg(\psi)]$, via an isogeny $\hat{\psi}$
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \node (E0) at (-4, 0) {$E$};
        \node (E1) at (0, 0) {$E'$};
        \node (E2) at (4, 0) {$E$};

        \draw [->] (E0) -- (E1) node [midway, above] {$\psi$};
        \draw [->] (E1) -- (E2) node [midway, above] {$\hat{\psi}$};
        \draw [->] (E0) to [bend left] node [midway, above] {$[\deg(\psi)]$} (E2);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
The isogeny $\hat{\psi}: E' \to E$ has then the same degree as $\psi$, and is called the \emph{dual isogeny} of $\psi$.

Interestingly, the dual isogeny behaves like an adjoint w.r.t. the Weil pairing, i.e.
\begin{equation*}
    e_m(S, \phi(T)) = e_m(\hat{\phi}(S), T)
\end{equation*}
for an isogeny $\phi: E \to E'$ and the $m$-th Weil pairing $e_m$ of $E$ resp. $E'$ (see \cite[Prop.~III.8.2]{arithmetic_elliptic_curves}).

\subsection{The endomorphism ring}
For an elliptic curve $E$, we write from now on $\End(E)$ for the set of isogenies $E \to E$.
Via composition and pointwise addition, this becomes a (possibly noncommutative) unital ring.
The existence of the multiplication-by-$m$ isogeny implies that there is a ring homomorphism
\begin{equation*}
    \Z \to \End(E)
\end{equation*}
As it turns out, this is always injective \cite[Prop.~III.4.2]{arithmetic_elliptic_curves}, hence the endomorphism ring has characteristic 0.
Much more is known about the endomorphism ring, though.
In particular, there is the following theorem
\begin{theorem}
    Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over $k$. Then $\End(E)$ is one of the following
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The ring of integers $\Z$.
        \item An order in a quadratic imaginary number field.
        \item An order in the quaternion algebra ramified exactly at $p$ and $\infty$, where $p = \mathrm{char}(k)$.
    \end{itemize}
    If $\mathrm{char}(k) = 0$, only the first two are possible.
    Similarly, if $\mathrm{char}(k) \neq 0$, only the last two are possible. 
\end{theorem}
For a proof, see e.g. \cite[Corollary~III.9.4]{arithmetic_elliptic_curves}.

If $k \subseteq \bar{\F}_p$, we call the curve $E$ \emph{ordinary} in the second case and \emph{supersingular} in the third case.
There are some other fundamental differences between those two types, as displayed in the following table.
Denote by $\pi_E$ the $q$-th power Frobenius, where $E$ is defined over $\F_q$.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c | c}
        ordinary & supersingular \\
        \hline
        $[p]$ has separability degree $p$ & $[p]$ is totally inseparable \\
        $E[p] \cong \Z/p\Z$ & $E[p] = \{ \IdPoint \}$ \\
        $\End(E)$ is commutative & $\End(E)$ is not commutative \\
        $\mathrm{Tr}(\pi_E) \not\equiv 0 \mod p$ & $\mathrm{Tr}(\pi_E) \equiv 0 \mod p$ \\
        $\hat{\pi}_E$ separable & $\hat{\pi}_E$ totally inseparable \\
        $p \notdivides d(\End(E))$ and $p \notdivides d(\Z[\pi_E])$ & $p \divides d(\Z[\pi_E])$
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
Note that the trace
\footnote{By trace, we mean either the trace in the quadratic imaginary number field, or the reduced trace in the quaternion algebra. In particular, if $\pi_E = \pm p$ (the supersingular setting with $E/\F_{p^2}$), we have $\mathrm{Tr}(\pi_E) = \pm 2p$.}
of the Frobenius endomorphism $\mathrm{Tr}(\pi_E)$ is of some importance, as (in the ordinary case) it determines the quadratic imaginary number field that contains $\End(E)$.
Furthermore, there is the relationship
\begin{equation*}
    \mathrm{Tr}(\pi_E) = q + 1 - \#E(\F_q)
\end{equation*}
There is also the famous theorem by Hasse \cite[Thm V.1.1]{arithmetic_elliptic_curves} which states that
\begin{equation*}
    |\#E(\F_q) - q - 1| \leq 2\sqrt{q}
\end{equation*}
In particular, this implies that $|\mathrm{Tr}(\pi_E)| \leq 2\sqrt{q}$.
Furthermore, if $E/\F_q$ is ordinary, the discriminant of the order $\End(E)$ divides the discriminant $d(\Z[\pi_E])$, as $\Z[\pi_E] \subseteq \End(E)$.
Now it follows that $-4q < d(\End(E)) < 0$ in this case, because $d(\Z[\pi_E]) = \mathrm{Tr}(\pi_E)^2 - 4q$.

Finally, note that in a supersingular elliptic curve, we always have $[p] = \epsilon \pi^2$, where now $\pi: E \to E^{(p)}$ the the $p$-th power Frobenius and $\epsilon$ is an automorphisms of $E$.
However, it is not too hard to show \cite[Thm~III.10.1]{arithmetic_elliptic_curves} that
\begin{equation*}
    \#\mathrm{Aut}(E) = \begin{cases}
        2 & \text{if $j(E) \neq 0, 1728$} \\
        4 & \text{if $j(E) = 1728$} \\
        6 & \text{if $j(E) = 0$}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
in the case $\mathrm{char}(k) \neq 2, 3$.
Thus we see that either $j(E) \in \{ 0, 1728 \}$ or $[p] = \pm\pi^2$, and so in both cases that $j(E) \in \F_{p^2}$.
In other words, every supersingular curve is isomorphic to a curve over $\F_{p^2}$.

\section{The ordinary isogeny graph}

In cryptography, we are of course not just interested in abstract structure of elliptic curves and isogenies, but also in computing with them.
A fundamental algorithm based on the Velu formulas allows to compute the curve $E/G$ and the isogeny $E \to E/G$ for a finite subgroup $G \leq E$ in time polynomial in $\#G$.
However, in the general case, there is no way how one can represent or compute an isogeny of exponentially large degree.
This is where one can do cryptography, since for smooth-degree isogenies $\psi$, we can factor them into a sequence of small degree isogenies, and evaluate them one after the other.
However, if this factorization is not known, it seems very hard to evaluate the isogeny.

The underlying structure of this approach (and others) can now be captured by the $l$-isogeny graph $\Gamma_l(\F_q)$, for a prime $l \neq p$.
For this chapter, and the rest of this work, we assume $p = \mathrm{char}(k) \neq 2, 3$.
\begin{definition}
    Denote by $\Gamma_l(k)$ the graph whose vertices are isomorphism classes of elliptic curves over $k$, and the edges are the degree $l$ isogenies (again up to isomorphism
    \footnote{We say two isogenies $\phi, \psi: E \to E'$ are isomorphic, if there are automorphisms $\tau \in \mathrm{Aut}(E)$ and $\rho \in \mathrm{Aut}(E')$ such that $\phi = \rho \circ \psi \circ \tau$.
    Note that $\mathrm{Aut}(E) = \{ \pm 1 \}$ unless $j(E) \in \{ 0, 1728 \}$ (assuming $\mathrm{char}(k) \neq 2, 3$), so this case occurs only at the two vertices with j-invariants $0$ and $1728$.}) 
    between them (with multiplicity).
\end{definition}
Since there is never an isogeny between ordinary and supersingular curves, each connected component of $\Gamma_l(\F_q)$ contains either only ordinary or supersingular curves.
Hence, we will call them ordinary and supersingular connected components, respectively.
Furthermore, the existence of the dual isogeny shows that this graph is undirected.
We also know that if $p \neq 2, 3$ and $l \neq p$, the graph $\Gamma_l(\bar{\F}_p)$ is $(l + 1)$-regular except at the j-invariants $0$ and $1728$, since there are exactly $l + 1$ subgroups of order $l$ in $E[l] \cong (\Z/l\Z)^2$.

Note that when doing computations with this graph, we identify each vertex with the j-invariant of the corresponding curves.
This makes it easy to work with isomorphism classes of elliptic curves.
Furthermore, we observe that $\Gamma_l(\F_q)$ has exactly $q$ vertices, since there are that many j-invariants $j \in \F_q$.

\input{section_ordinary_graphs.tex}

\section{The supersingular isogeny graph}
\label{sec:supersingular_isogeny_graph}
After studying the ordinary connected components of the $l$-isogeny graph $\Gamma_l(\F_q)$, we now come to the supersingular component(s).
First, note that all supersingular j-invariants are defined over $\F_{p^2}$, and so we will assume $q = p^2$ for this section.

In the supersingular setting, the endomorphism ring is now non-commutative.
There still exists a non-commutative analogue of the class group action, but using it is significantly harder.
Mainly, because the theory of quaternion algebras is more complicated, and its class group structure is less studied.
\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width = 0.5\textwidth]{../example_supersingular.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption{
        \label{fig:example_supersingular_graph} The supersingular 5-isogeny graph over $\F_{101^2}$.
        The element $\mathrm{z}$ is a generator of $\F_{101^2}$ as in Figure~\ref{fig:example_vulcanos}.
    }
\end{figure}
Instead, there is the famous result of Pizer, which states that supersingular isogeny graphs (i.e. the supersingular part of $\Gamma_l(\F_q)$) are so called Ramajuan graphs, that is have excellent expander properties.
We will introduce this result in this section, but without proof.
\begin{definition}
    \label{def:expander}
    A $d$-regular graph $G$ is called $\epsilon$-expander, if the eigenvalues $\lambda_1 > ... > \lambda_n$ of its adjacency matrix satisfy
    \begin{equation*}
        |\lambda_2|, |\lambda_n| \leq (1 - \epsilon) d
    \end{equation*}
\end{definition}
In the literature, expander graphs are often defined by the use of the expansion ration
\begin{equation*}
    h(G) := \min_{S \subseteq V, \ \#S \leq \frac n 2} \frac {\#\partial S} {\# S}
\end{equation*}
of a graph $G = (V, E)$.
Here $\partial S$ is the edge boundary, i.e. the set of edges between a point in $S$ and a point in $V \setminus S$.

The connection between those two definitions is then given by the Cheeger-inequality
\begin{prop}
    Let $G$ be a $d$-regular graph such that its adjacency matrix has eigenvalues $\lambda_1 > ... > \lambda_n$.
    Then
    \begin{equation*}
        \frac {d - \lambda_2} 2 \leq h(G) \leq \sqrt{2d(d - \lambda_2)}
    \end{equation*}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    See e.g. \cite{cheeger_inequality}.
\end{proof}
This inequality only correlates the so-called spectral gap $d - \lambda_2$ with $h(G)$, and does not bound $|\lambda_n|$.
In many cases, bounds on the spectral gap or expansion ration already suffice to show properties of expanders.
Because of this, expanders are usually defined as graphs for which only $\lambda_2$ or $h(G)$ are bounded.
Our definition~\ref{def:expander} is then sometimes called ``two-sided expander''.
However, we will never use one-sided expanders in this work, hence the above definition shall be sufficient.

The nice thing about the expansion ratio is that it gives more intuition on what the expander property means.
In particular, an expander graph is densely connected, i.e. by deleting a small number of edges, it is impossible to make the graph split into two (or more) connected components of relatively large size.
\begin{definition}
    A connected $d$-regular graph is called Ramajuan, if
    \begin{equation*}
        |\lambda_2|, |\lambda_n| \leq 2\sqrt{d - 1}
    \end{equation*}
    where $\lambda_1 > ... > \lambda_n$ are again the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix.
\end{definition}
It is known that the bound $2\sqrt{d - 1}$ is asymptotically optimal, i.e. for sufficiently large $n$, all $d$-regular graphs of $n$ vertices have $\lambda_2 \geq 2\sqrt{d - 1} - \epsilon$.
In that sense, we can say Ramajuan graphs are graphs with asymptotically optimal expansion properties.

One of the main properties of expander graphs is that random walks on them mix rapidly.
That is, the final vertex of relatively short random walks is distributed almost uniformly among all vertices.
\begin{prop}
    \label{prop:expander_random_walk}
    Let $G = (V, E)$ be a $d$-regular $\epsilon$-expander graph and $v \in V$ a vertex.
    Then the distribution of the final vertex of a random walk starting from $v$ of length $t$ is close to uniform, in particular, the $\ell_2$-statistical distance is bounded by $(1 - \epsilon)^t$.
\end{prop}
For a proof of this proposition, see e.g. Theorem~3.3 in this excellent survey on expander graphs \cite{expander_survey}.
Note that expander graphs used in cryptography are usually of exponential size, so this theorem says that a random walk of polynomial length already reaches all vertices of the graph.

Now we come to the anticipated result, that supersingular isogeny graphs are expander graphs.
\begin{definition}
    The \emph{supersingular $l$-isogeny graph over $\F_{p^2}$} is the subgraph of $\Gamma_l(\F_{p^2})$ induced by all (isomorphism classes of) supersingular curves over $\F_{p^2}$.
\end{definition}
Since the supersingular $l$-isogeny graph is disconnected from the rest of $\Gamma_l(\F_{p^2})$, we see that it is an $(l + 1)$-regular graph
\footnote{We will be sloppy here, and call the supersingular $l$-isogeny graph $(l + 1)$-regular, even though it can contain up to two vertices of smaller degree (those with j-invariants $0$ and $1728$).}.
We also know its size exactly, which directly follows from a classical result on the number of supersingular curves over $\F_{p^2}$.
\begin{prop}
    For $p \geq 5$, there are exactly
    \begin{equation*}
        \left\lfloor \frac p {12} \right\rfloor + \begin{cases}
            0 & \text{if $p \equiv 1 \mod 12$} \\
            1 & \text{if $p \equiv 5, 7 \mod 12$} \\
            2 & \text{if $p \equiv 11 \mod 12$}
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    supersingular elliptic curves over $\F_{p^2}$.
\end{prop}
For a proof of this statement, see e.g. \cite[Thm~V.4.1]{arithmetic_elliptic_curves}.

In \cite{supersingular_graphs_ramajuan}, Pizer has now shown that
\begin{theorem}
    \label{prop:supersingular_graph_ramajuan}
    The supersingular $l$-isogeny graph is Ramajuan.
\end{theorem}
This means that there is a huge difference between the ordinary and supersingular graphs.
For example, there is always a path of length $O(\log(p))$ between two curves in the supersingular graph, but in the ordinary graph, such a path does not exist in many cases.
We will try to quantify this in the last section.
The idea of our research is to utilize these differences in order to find random, supersingular curves.

Finally, we also want to shortly comment on supersingular isogeny graphs over $\F_p$.
\begin{remark}
    As we defined it, the graph $\Gamma_l(\F_p)$ is of course a subgraph of $\Gamma_l(\F_{p^2})$.
    Even so, at least the supersingular part of $\Gamma_l(\F_p)$ is not particularly useful, as most of the structure does not carry over from $\Gamma_l(\F_{p^2})$.
    For example, it is not $(l + 1)$-regular anymore.

    Nevertheless, there are many cryptosystems (and other applications) that work with a supersingular $l$-isogeny graph over $\F_p$.
    However, they do not use $\Gamma_l(\F_p)$, but a graph $G$ whose vertices are $\F_p$-isomorphism classes of supersingular curves, i.e. curves up to isomorphism defined over $\F_p$.
    Note that now the j-invariant does not characterize the isomorphism classes anymore, in particular, for every $j \in \F_p$ there are two $\F_p$-isomorphism classes corresponding to this j-invariant.
    Hence, $G$ is not a subgraph of $\Gamma_l(\F_p)$, and it turns out that its structure is more similar to ordinary isogeny volcanoes than to a supersingular expander graph.
\end{remark}
Since these graphs are not used in our work, we will leave it at this short remark.

\section{Modular polynomials}
If we want to work computationally with isogeny graphs, we need a way to explicitly compute them.
The simplest way to find the $m$-isogeny neighbors of a curve $E$ is to compute $E[m]$ and find the cyclic order-$m$-subgroups.
While this works in many cases, it can happen that the torsion group $E[m]$ only lies in an extension of $\F_q$ of degree $O(m^2)$, in which it is very costly to work.
Furthermore, there are many other applications where a torsion-based approach does not work at all.

The class group action is also not a suitable tool, since computing the class group or even the action of an ideal is already difficult.
For the latter, probably the best approach is to work again with the torsion subgroups, and so we gain nothing.
Furthermore, we only have the class group action in the ordinary case, but in cryptography, we are primarily interested in the supersingular setting.

One solution to this problem is given by modular curves, which give a very useful algebraic structure to the $l$-isogeny graph.
In particular, the existence of a non-integer $l$-isogeny between curves is an algebraically closed condition, i.e. is given by an algebraic curve.

The classical way to study this is by using the theory of modular forms.
Since this is out of the scope of this work, we refer to \cite[§11]{cox_primes_of_form} for an introduction of the topic.
The basic result is the following.
\begin{theorem}
    \label{prop:complex_mod_poly}
    For $m \geq 2$ there is an irreducible and monic polynomial
    \begin{equation*}
        \Phi_m(X, Y) \in \Z[X, Y]
    \end{equation*}
    such that for elliptic curves $E, E'$ defined over $\C$, there is a cyclic $m$-isogeny $E \to E'$ if and only if $\Phi_m(j(E), j(E')) = 0$.
\end{theorem}
This polynomial is called the \emph{(classical) modular polynomial of level $m$}.
A proof of this theorem is e.g. given in \cite[Thm~11.18]{cox_primes_of_form}.
A few corollaries of this theorem can easily be inferred.
\begin{corollary}
    Let $m \geq 2$. Then we have
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\Phi_m$ is symmetric, i.e. $\Phi_m(X, Y) = \Phi_m(Y, X)$.
        \item $\Phi_m$ has degree $\psi(m)$ (as polynomial in $X$), where $\psi$ is the Dedekind $\psi$-function
        \begin{equation*}
            \psi(m) = m \prod_{p \divides m} 1 + \frac 1 p
        \end{equation*}
    \end{itemize}
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
    The first statement follows from the existence of the dual isogeny.
    For the second statement, note that for each elliptic curve $E$ over $\C$, the degree of $\Phi_m(X, j(E))$ is the number of curves $E'$ with an $m$-isogeny $E \to E'$, which is equal to the number of cyclic subgroups $G \leq E \cong (\mathbb{R}/\Z)^2$ of size $m$.
    By the Chinese Remainder theorem, this is a multiplicative function, and for a prime power $m = p^k$, the number is
    \begin{align*}
       &\#\bigl\{ G \leq (\Z/m\Z)^2 \ \bigm| \ \#G = m \bigr\} \\
       =& \#\bigl\{ \langle (1, \alpha) \rangle \ \bigm| \ \alpha \in \Z/m\Z \bigr\} + \#\bigl\{ \langle (\alpha, 1) \rangle \ \bigm| \ \alpha \in (\Z/m\Z) \setminus (\Z/m\Z)^* \bigr\} \\
       =& p^k + \#\bigl\{ \langle (\alpha, 1) \rangle \ \bigm| \ \alpha \in p(\Z/m\Z) \bigr\} = p^k + p^{k - 1} \\
       =& m \left( 1 + \frac 1 p \right) \qedhere
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}
Since we are mainly interested in the case of finite fields, we have to show that the modular polynomial behaves well under reductions mod $p$.
This theory relies on Hensel lifting, and has been explored by \cite{deuring_endomorphism_rings}.
\begin{lemma}
    \label{prop:modified_hensel_lifting}
    Let $f \in \O_K[X]$ be a polynomial for some number field $K$ with a prime $\p$.
    If $f(X) \mod \p \in \F_q[X]$ has a root $\alpha$, then then there is a finite field extension $L/K$, a prime $\p$ of $\O_L$ and some $\alpha_0 \in \O_L$ such that
    \begin{equation*}
        f(\alpha_0) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \alpha_0 \equiv \alpha \mod \p
    \end{equation*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Follows by Hensel's Lemma.
\end{proof}
The next lemma allows us to lift curves connected by an isogeny over $\F_q$ to $\C$.
This is very similar to the well-known lifting theorem of Deuring, which is about lifting a curve together with an endomorphism.
Our situation is somewhat simpler, since we can take different lifts for the domain and codomain curves.
\begin{lemma}
    Let $E$ and $E'$ be curves over $\F_q$ and $\phi: E \to E'$ a cyclic $m$-isogeny.
    Then there exist curves $E_0$, $E_0'$ with j-invariant in $\O_K$ for some number field $K$ with a prime $\p$ over $p = \mathrm{char}(K)$ and an isogeny $\phi_0: E_0 \to E_0'$ such that
    \begin{equation*}
        \tilde{E}_0 = E, \ \tilde{E}_0' = E' \quad \text{and} \quad \tilde{\phi}_0 = \phi
    \end{equation*}
    where $\tilde{\cdot}$ is the reduction modulo $\p$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    This proof is somewhat technical, but the basic idea is simple.
    An isogeny $E \to E'$ corresponds to polynomials (more precisely, elements of $k[E]$) satisfying the equation of $E'$.
    In other words, we have to lift polynomials over $\F_q$ to a number field such that certain equations are satisfied.
    This however can be done by Hensel's lemma.
    The only difficulty is that we have to lift the correct coefficient in the correct order, to resolve all required dependencies.

    Consider some arbitrary lift $E_0$ and $E_0'$ of $E$ resp. $E'$ to a number field $K$ such that $j(E_0), j(E_0') \in \O_K$.
    Assume that $E_0'$ is defined by a homogeneous polynomial $f = Y^2Z - X^3 - AXZ^2 - BZ^3 \in \O_K[X, Y, Z]$.
    Finally, assume\footnote{It is a simple consequence of the geometry of elliptic curves that every isogeny is of such a form.} $\phi = [u : Y v : w]$ with polynomials $u, v, w \in \F_q[X]$ and choose an arbitrary lift $v_0, w_0 \in \O_K[X]$ of $v$ resp. $w$.
    Hence the coefficients $u^{(0)}, ..., u^{(n)}$ of $u \in \F_q[X]$ are a root of
    \begin{equation*}
        f(\sum T_i X^i, Y v_0, w_0) = \sum_i a_i(T_0, ..., T_n) X^i \in \O_K[X][T_0, ..., T_n]
    \end{equation*}
    modulo $\p$.
    Note that the coefficient of $X^j$ in $(\sum_i T_i X^i)^3$ contains the monomial $T_0^2 T_j$, and 
    Since there are infinitely many lifts of $A$ resp. $B$, we can assume wlog that also the coefficient $a_j(T_0, ..., T_n)$ in $f(\sum T_i X^i, Y v, w)$ does.
    Furthermore, $a_j$ is in $\O_K[T_0, ..., T_j]$, i.e. only depends on $T_0, ..., T_j$.

    We assume wlog $u^{(0)} \neq 0$, otherwise we can move $E'$ in $x$-direction by any element in $\F_q$.

    We know that $u^{(0)}$ is a root of $a_0$ modulo $\p$, and so Lemma~\ref{prop:modified_hensel_lifting} shows that there is a lift $u^{(0)}_0$ of $u^{(0)}$ in some number field $L_0/K$ with $a_0(u^{(0)}_0) = 0$.
    We now proceed by induction.
    Since $u_0^{(0)} \neq 0$, we see that $a_i(u_0^{(0)}, ..., u_0^{(i - 1)}, T_i)$ contains the monomial $T_i$, and so applying the lemma again, we also find lifts $u^{(1)}_0, ..., u^{(n)}_0 \in \O_L/K$ with $a_i(u^{(0)}_0, ..., u^{(i)}_0) = 0$.
    In other words, we found a lift $u_0$ of $u$ in $\O_L[X]$ such that $f(u_0, Y v_0, w) = 0$.
    Now we can set $\phi_0 = [u_0 : Y v_0 : w_0]: E_0 \to E_0'$ and the claim follows.
\end{proof}
Using a little bit more Hensel lifting, we now can pull down the properties of $\Phi_m$ to finite fields.
\begin{prop}
    For $m \geq 2$ and Elliptic Curves $E$ and $E'$ over $\F_q$, have $\Phi_m(j(E), j(E')) = 0 \in \F_q$ if and only if there is a cyclic $m$-isogeny $E \to E'$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    First, consider the direction $\Leftarrow$.
    Here the previous Lemma shows that we can lift the situation to $m$-isogenous curves $E_0$ and $E_0'$ over a number field $K$, and so have by Prop.~\ref{prop:complex_mod_poly} that
    \begin{equation*}
        \Phi_m(j(E_0), j(E_0')) = 0
    \end{equation*}
    Furthermore we know that $j(E_0), j(E_0') \in \O_K$, and so we clearly have for the reduction modulo $\p$ that
    \begin{equation*}
        \Phi_m(j(E), j(E')) \equiv \Phi_m(j(E_0), j(E_0')) \equiv 0 \mod \p
    \end{equation*}

    Now we show the direction $\Rightarrow$.
    We have $\Phi_m(j(E), j(E')) = 0 \in \F_q$, thus there is a number field $K$ with a prime $\p$ over $p = \mathrm{char}(\F_q)$ and $x, y \in \O_K$ such that
    \begin{equation*}
        \Phi_m(x, y) \equiv 0 \mod \p \quad \text{and} \quad x \equiv j(E), \ y \equiv j(E') \mod \p
    \end{equation*}
    Now we can again use Lemma~\ref{prop:modified_hensel_lifting} to find a number field $L/K$, a prime $\q$ over $\p$ and $x' \in \O_L$ such that $x' \equiv x \mod \q$ and $\Phi_m(x', y) = 0 \in K_\p$.
    In particular, there are curves $E$, $E'$ over $L$ with j-invariants $x'$ resp. $y$, and thus by Prop.~\ref{prop:complex_mod_poly}, there is a cyclic $m$-isogeny $E \to E'$.
    Therefore, there is also an $m$-isogeny between the curves $\tilde{E}$ and $\tilde{E}'$, which are the reductions of $E$ resp. $E'$ modulo $\q$.
\end{proof}
Some properties however cannot be transferred to the finite field case.
For example, in the finite field case, $\Phi_m$ might not be irreducible anymore.
In fact, it is easy to see that
\begin{equation*}
    \Phi_p(X, Y) \equiv -(X^p - Y)(Y^p - X) \mod p
\end{equation*}
since the only $p$-isogenies over a field of characteristic $p$ are the Frobenius and its conjugate.

The modular polynomial is an indispensable tool when doing computations on the isogeny graph.
In particular, when combined with an algorithm to factor polynomials over $\F_q$, it allows us to compute all the neighbors of a curve $E$ in the $l$-isogeny graph.
For example Sutherland's supersingular test (see Section~\ref{sec:sutherlands_supersingularity_test}) uses modular polynomials for walks in the isogeny graph, and distinguishes ordinary and supersingular curves by the structure of their isogeny graph neighborhoods.
Another example is Shoof's algorithm \cite{shoof_point_counting} for counting $\F_q$-rational points on a curve, which also relies on modular polynomials.

Therefore, computing modular polynomials is an important task.
The most classical approach is to mimic to proof of Theorem~\ref{prop:complex_mod_poly}, i.e. view elliptic curves as lattices over $\C$ and compute the Fourier coefficients of the $j$-function.
However, one main problem is that the coefficients in the modular polynomial become very large very fast.
For example, $\Phi_5$ has already the constant coefficient
\begin{equation*}
    141359947154721358697753474691071362751004672000
\end{equation*}
In many cases, we only need the value of $\Phi_m$ modulo a prime $p$, and thus other algorithms can easily be faster.
A whole line of work tries to use isogeny graphs over finite fields to find such an algorithm, see e.g. \cite{compute_modular_polynomial} and \cite{compute_modular_polynomial2}.
Using the Chinese Remainder theorem, these algorithms can also be used to find $\Phi_m$ over $\C$ by collecting information modulo many different primes.
