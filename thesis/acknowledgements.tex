    First and foremost, I want to thank my dissertation supervisor, Cristophe Petit, who brought me in contact with this fascinating topic and provided invaluable advice throughout the research and writing process. 
    Additionally, I want to thank my previous professor, Jens Zumbr√§gel, for vastly supporting me on my way into research.
    Without him, I would not be where I am now.
